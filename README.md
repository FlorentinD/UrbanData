# Urban Data Seminar

## Current progress

- [x] Find data sources & corresponding APIs
- [x] Study existing python frameworks for data extraction
- [x] Get Packages to work (needed conda on windows)  
- [x] Create small examples for the APIs
- [x] Get a broad overview of Map-Visualization frameworks in python
- [ ] Find working python framework for newer WMS versions
- [ ] What capabilities has OverPassQL ? (possibly easy layer extraction)
- [ ] Look into data storage formats (f.i. *gml*, *geojson*)
- [ ] Look into specific Map-Visualization framework
  
## Package dependency

- OWSLib (for request on WMS and WFS for openDataDresden)
- OSMPythonTools (for access to openstreetmap services)
