# Urban Data Seminar

## Todo

- [ ] Find working python framework for newer WMS versions (not really a high priotity if WFS service works) (may be supported directly by folium)
- [ ] How to convert json from overpassQL to geojson (in progress -- done for way-objects)
- [ ] How to translate gml into geojson?
- [ ] GeoPandas?
  
## Package dependency

- OWSLib (for request on WMS and WFS for openDataDresden)
- OSMPythonTools (for access to openstreetmap services)
