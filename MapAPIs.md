# Map APIs
* How to access different layers?
* How to access places in a given area?

## Google Maps
* needs a billing account (for the case that the requests exceed the free credit of 200$/month)
* therefore not further investigated

## OpenstreetView


# Other resources

## City of Dresden?
* possibly good access to different layers (as probably working with ArcGIS)


## Chair of Geoinformatics
* possibly more detailed data about Dresden (useful for layering)
