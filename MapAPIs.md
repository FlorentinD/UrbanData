* How to access different layers?
* How to access places in a given area?
  
### Google Maps

* needs a billing account (for the case that the requests exceed the free credit of 200$/month)

### OpenstreetView

* TODO

## Other resources

### OpenData Dresden

* [openData Dresden](https://opendata.dresden.de/DreiD/) looks promising
