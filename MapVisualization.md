# Map Visualization

* Requirement:
  * alter shown layers
  * zoom in/out

## Static Map

* [Mapnik](https://mapnik.org/)

## Slippy Map
* [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) 

* obviously more complex
* will be considered in the future, as for now the area of interest is restricted to Dresden (particulary if most of the additional data sources wil from opendata.dresden)
