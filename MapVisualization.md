# Map Visualization

* Requirement:
  * alter shown layers
  * zoom in/out

## Static Map

* matplotlib
* [Mapnik](https://mapnik.org/)

## Slippy Map

* [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)
  * supports Png, GeoJSON, TopoJSON files as layers
  * or could add a colorline based on a list of points latitude and longitude
  * possible to add markers

* obviously more complex
* will be considered in the future, as for now the area of interest is restricted to Dresden (particulary if most of the additional data sources wil from opendata.dresden)
